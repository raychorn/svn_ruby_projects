<h2>Answers: General</h2>
<ul><h3>Do you offer custom packages? <a name="faq_1" id="faq_1"></a></h3>

<p>That depends on what your definition of “custom” is… We don’t offer
any plans that you can set the features and/or limits, but our plan
lineup spans the web hosting spectrum. Why go through the trouble of
creating your own custom package when we have affordable options that
have been expertly designed to fit your website. </p>

  <div class="top"><a href="#faq_top">Back to top</a></div>

<h3>Will you match a competitor's price? <a name="faq_3" id="faq_3"></a></h3>

<p>No. We quantified all of the necessary variables and divided by the
number of moons around Jupiter to come up with our plan pricing. We are
not a bottom-of-the-barrel hosting company, and our focus is on your
EzCheapSites.Com experience (which will be considerably better than any $2/mo
hosting experience).</p>

  <div class="top"><a href="#faq_top">Back to top</a></div>

<h3>How long has EzCheapSites.Com been in business? <a name="faq_4" id="faq_4"></a></h3>

<p>EzCheapSites.Com was formed officially in early 1999, which means we've been
around for over 7 years. We are a privately-held company operating out
of San Ramon, California. Over the years we've built up quite a
reputation for our dedication to our customers and our custom-made
hosting features.</p>

  <div class="top"><a href="#faq_top">Back to top</a></div>

<h3>How many websites does EzCheapSites.Com host? <a name="faq_5" id="faq_5"></a></h3>

<p>Start counting one number per second for the next two days, seven
hours, thirty-three minutes and twenty seconds, and you’ll be getting
to the neighborhood of how many sites we host… If you want to save
yourself some trouble, you can just trust us when we say, “We host a
lot of sites.” We'd love to have you join us!</p>

  <div class="top"><a href="#faq_top">Back to top</a></div>

<h3>Do you give non-profit or educational discounts? <a name="faq_8" id="faq_8"></a></h3>

<p>No. Sorry. We keep our prices low for everyone, and are therefore
unable to offer additional non-profit or educational discounts. We like
to think that buying hosting from EzCheapSites.Com can be an educational
experience in and of itself: In choosing EzCheapSites.Com, you learn about supply
and demand, market leadership, brand differentiation, and you will even
get to sit at the virtual “cool kids’ table.”</p>

  <div class="top"><a href="#faq_top">Back to top</a></div>

<h3>My website gets a lot of traffic--will this be a problem? <a name="faq_10" id="faq_10"></a></h3>

<p>This usually depends on the nature of your website. While relatively
straightforward sites (think basic html/xhtml content, most shopping
sites, webpages, blogs, etc.) can receive tens of thousands of hits at
any given time and work perfectly fine, problems can arise with more
complex sites--sites with lots of images, scripts or interactivity with
visitors. Tens of thousands of users each accessing a database at the
same time can cause quite a strain on a server and might be too much
for a shared web hosting environment.</p>

<p>The thing to remember is that the term "shared hosting" (which is
another term for standard web hosting) means that your site will share
a server with other users. This allows for plenty of usage while
keeping prices low, but certain sites may not be appropriate for such
an environment. If you are unsure whether your high volume website will
work with our shared plans, please feel free to e-mail our <a href="mailto:sales@EzCheapSites.Com">sales department</a>, and we will be happy to assist you in determining the best solution for your needs.</p>

  <div class="top"><a href="#faq_top">Back to top</a></div>

<h3>What if I need more space and bandwidth? <a name="faq_14" id="faq_14"></a></h3>

<p>If you need additional space and bandwidth, you can simply upgrade
your account to a higher plan. Upgrading your plan provides a much
better value than paying for more bandwidth and storage on the side.</p>

  <div class="top"><a href="#faq_top">Back to top</a></div>

</ul><h2>Answers: Features and Technology</h2>
<ul><h3>Do you have [insert feature name here]? <a name="faq_11" id="faq_11"></a></h3>

<p>Probably. We support just about everything under the sun (and a few things over the sun). Check out our <a href="web_hosting.htm">web hosting plan comparison</a>
page for information on all the features we offer. One of the best
things about having a EzCheapSites.Com account is that you are going to get the
features you are looking for and then some. EzCheapSites.Com has several exclusive
homegrown software developments that are designed to make your web
hosting experience as enjoyable as possible.</p>

  <div class="top"><a href="#faq_top">Back to top</a></div>

<h3>I have my own SSL certificate--can EzCheapSites.Com install it for me? <a name="faq_13" id="faq_13"></a></h3>

<p>Sure! We allow you to use your own SSL certificate if you'd like.
There is a one time $15 installation fee for all custom SSL
certificates. Contact our <a href="mailto:customer.service@EzCheapSites.Com">customer service department</a> for assistance.</p>

  <div class="top"><a href="#faq_top">Back to top</a></div>

<h3>What do you mean by "low site to server ratios" and how does this benefit me? <a name="faq_17" id="faq_17"></a></h3>

<p>The number of accounts hosted on a web server can have a significant
impact on how quickly that server is able to respond to page requests.
Since all users of a server share system resources such as processor
time and RAM, a server with too many accounts can be slow to respond
and cause your site's visitors to become frustrated and leave.</p>

<p>Many hosting companies pack too many accounts onto each server in an
effort to maximize profit. At EzCheapSites.Com, we feel that the long term
customer satisfaction resulting from providing high performance hosting
is far more important than the short term profits made by overfilling
servers. Our customers love the extra speed they get at EzCheapSites.Com, making
them more than happy to recommend EzCheapSites.Com to their friends, family and
website visitors.</p>

<p>Join EzCheapSites.Com today and experience the many benefits of our "undercrowded" servers!</p>

  <div class="top"><a href="#faq_top">Back to top</a></div>

<h3>What is "available server power" and how does it benefit me? <a name="faq_18" id="faq_18"></a></h3>

<p>The amount of server power or server system resources available to
each hosting account depends on the number of other websites sharing a
given web server. A server's total processor and memory (RAM) is shared
by all of the accounts on that server.</p>

<p>All of our accounts are hosted on servers with much fewer accounts
than the majority of other web hosts. But, above and beyond that,
accounts on our Gold plan will be on servers with <strong>half as many accounts</strong> as servers hosting Silver plan accounts.</p>

<p>Servers hosting Diamond plan customers will have <strong>one quarter as many accounts</strong>
as the Silver plan. This ultra low site to server ratio means that each
individual Diamond hosting account has roughly four times the share of
the server's processor and memory as does a Silver account. That's a
lot of power!</p>

  <div class="top"><a href="#faq_top">Back to top</a></div>

<h3>Is your network fast and reliable? <a name="faq_19" id="faq_19"></a></h3>

<p>Yes--very. (Imagine that we are standing next to you moving our
hands rapidly and snapping to indicate how fast our servers really
are…) EzCheapSites.Com's servers are connected to an extremely powerful and fully
redundant network (no single point of failure). Our network has over 20
GB/s of available bandwidth from Tier 1 transit providers.</p>

<p style="display:none;"><a href="web_hosting.htmfeatures.php#technology_network">Click here</a> for more information on our network.</p>

  <div class="top"><a href="#faq_top">Back to top</a></div>

<h3>What is the difference between NetAdmin and Backstage?  Which one should I use to manage my account? <a name="faq_25" id="faq_25"></a></h3>

<p>Backstage is our central customer control panel. It allows you to
view your billing and contact information, manage all of your EzCheapSites.Com
services, view and submit new support tickets, buy, transfer and manage
domain names, view important announcements from EzCheapSites.Com customer service
and grant other users access to your account.</p>

<p>NetAdmin is the control panel used to manage features of a specific
web hosting account. It allows you to manage email features and mySQL
databases, autoinstall scripts, view web statistics and much, much
more. Through Backstage you can access the NetAdmin control panels for
all of your hosting accounts without needing to login to a separate
interface for each one.</p>

<p style="display:none;"><strong>You can access every part of your account from within Backstage.</strong>
Backstage provides automatic login to NetAdmin, so there is no need to
login to NetAdmin directly. To login to Backstage, simply point your
browser to <a href="https://backstage.EzCheapSites.Com/">https://backstage.EzCheapSites.Com/</a> or click the "Customer Login" link at the very top of the main EzCheapSites.Com website.</p>

<p style="display:none;">Backstage and NetAdmin are developed in-house by the <a href="http://engineering.EzCheapSites.Com/" target="_blank">EzCheapSites.Com Engineering Team</a>, and are constantly being updated with exciting new features!</p>

  <div class="top"><a href="#faq_top">Back to top</a></div>

<h3>Do you do regular backups of my account? <a name="faq_26" id="faq_26"></a></h3>

<p>Yes, we perform nightly backups on all accounts, but <strong>don't count on our backups alone!</strong>  Your website is important, and <strong>you are the one ultimately responsible for ensuring that your data is backed up!</strong></p>

<p style="display:none;">We make every effort to back up all account data on a nightly basis,
but we can’t guarantee that our backups will be complete, up to date or
even available at all. We are not responsible in the event that some or
all of your account data and settings are lost (please see our <a href="http://www.EzCheapSites.Com/support/serviceagreement.php">service agreement</a>
for more information).*This note may sound cold and heartless, but it
helps reinforce the importance of making your own site backups.</p>

<p>You should <strong>always</strong> keep an up to date copy of your
website on your local computer; by doing this you will always have a
copy of your site on hand in the event of data loss. You can easily
download file, database and settings backups from the backup area of
NetAdmin.</p>

  <div class="top"><a href="#faq_top">Back to top</a></div>

</ul><h2>Answers: Ordering</h2>
<ul><h3>My order wasn't setup immediately.  What should I do? <a name="faq_27" id="faq_27"></a></h3>

<p>Stop, drop, and roll... That is usually a good policy if you are
ever worried about something having gone wrong. As soon as you get up
and dust yourself off, you will likely find that your order has been
flagged for further review and verification by a customer service
representative (since our auto-provisioning system would typically have
you online within 15 minutes).</p>

<p>You do not need to take any further action. Our staff continuously
checks the order queue for orders requiring verification and will
contact you via email or phone if additional information is required to
process your order.</p>

<p>Orders are only manually reviewed during business hours Monday
through Friday. If your order is placed outside of business hours and
requires manual verification, it will be performed at the start of the
next business day. We appreciate your patience in this situation.</p>

<p>If for some reason you have not heard from our customer service department after a full business day, please <a href="mailto:sales@EzCheapSites.Com">let us know</a>.</p>

  <div class="top"><a href="#faq_top">Back to top</a></div>

<h3>I'm confused or having trouble with the ordering process.  Who should I contact for assistance? <a name="faq_28" id="faq_28"></a></h3>

<p>If you're having trouble ordering, our sales team will be happy to help!</p>

<p>You can contact our sales department at <a href="mailto:sales@EzCheapSites.Com">sales@EzCheapSites.Com</a> to chat with a friendly EzCheapSites.Com sales representative.</p>

<p>We're glad you decided to join the growing EzCheapSites.Com community, and we
look forward to providing you with outstanding web hosting service!</p>

  <div class="top"><a href="#faq_top">Back to top</a></div>

<h3>Can I register a new domain name at the same time I place my order? <a name="faq_29" id="faq_29"></a></h3>

<p>Yes !</p>

<p>You may search for your new Domain Name online using our <a href="https://www.securepaynet.net/gdshop/registrar/search.asp?prog_id=434820&ci=1774&" target="_blank">Domain Registrations Process.</a><br><br></p>

  <div class="top"><a href="#faq_top">Back to top</a></div>

<h3>Do I need to have a domain name picked out and registered before I submit my order? <a name="faq_31" id="faq_31"></a></h3>

<p>Picked out: Yes<br></p>

<p>Registered: No</p>

<p>When you place an order, the order form will ask you to enter a
domain name for your new account. Our web servers will be configured to
work with this domain name when your account is provisioned.</p>

<p>You do not, however, need to have this domain name registered before
you place an order. If you do not yet own the domain name, you should
make sure to verify that the domain name is actually available and not
already in use. You can do so at our <a href="https://www.securepaynet.net/gdshop/registrar/search.asp?prog_id=434820&ci=1774&" target="_blank">Domain Look-Up Page</a>.</p>

<p>You can register your domain name with EzCheapSites.Com (by using our <a href="https://www.securepaynet.net/gdshop/registrar/search.asp?prog_id=434820&ci=1774&" target="_blank">Domain Registrations Process</a>).</p>

  <div class="top"><a href="#faq_top">Back to top</a></div>

</ul><h2>Answers: Scripts and Programming</h2>
<ul><h3>Will you install my programs and scripts for me? <a name="faq_12" id="faq_12"></a></h3>

<p>We’re sorry, but we can’t accommodate that kind of support. Our
hosting accounts come with an autoinstaller that allows you to install
over 50 scripts with the click of a button. <a href="autoinstaller.htm">Click here</a>
for a complete listing of scripts that can be automatically installed.
In addition to those popular scripts, EzCheapSites.Com has written a
custom-installer for the popular Ruby on Rails based blog system, Typo.</p>

<p>If you need to install scripts that are not listed above, we cannot
assist you nor can we provide support for any of those third-party
scripts (even if they were installed with the autoinstaller). This
policy is not to withhold any specialized information or hoard our
team’s experience. It is impossible for all of our support staff to be
fully versed in every available script, and if we have not tested and
included the scripts in question, we would be jeopardizing the shared
hosting environment by letting them all run rampant across our network.</p>

  <div class="top"><a href="#faq_top">Back to top</a></div>

<h3>Will you install custom Perl modules? <a name="faq_32" id="faq_32"></a></h3>

<p>Yes. Our technical support team will install almost any Perl module
upon request. Simply contact customer service with your request.</p>

  <div class="top"><a href="#faq_top">Back to top</a></div>

</ul><h2>Answers: Domain Names</h2>
<ul><h3>Do you sell domain names or do I have to buy my domain from another company? <a name="faq_15" id="faq_15"></a></h3>

<p>EzCheapSites.Com does, in fact, sell domain names right here in our <a href="https://www.securepaynet.net/gdshop/registrar/search.asp?prog_id=434820&ci=1774&" target="_blank">Domain Registrations Process</a>.</p>

<p>Additionally, you can transfer your existing domain names to EzCheapSites.Com with the click of a button.</p>

<p>Domain names through EzCheapSites.Com cost as little as $1.99/year for the first year and we offer huge discounts for Bulk Domain Registrations.</p>

  <div class="top"><a href="#faq_top">Back to top</a></div>

<h3>I want to buy a domain name without hosting.  Where do I go to order just a domain name? <a name="faq_30" id="faq_30"></a></h3>

<p>We <a href="https://www.securepaynet.net/gdshop/registrar/search.asp?prog_id=434820&ci=1774&" target="_blank">sell Domain Name Registrations</a> as a standalone service, if you prefer…  but if you aren’t experiencing EzCheapSites.Com hosting, you are missing out on our core
competency, and we <i>can’t</i> give you an opportunity to do that.</p>

<p>Once you receive your web hosting account information, you can
transfer existing and purchase new domains using the "Domains" tab in
our <a href="https://www.securepaynet.net/gdshop/registrar/search.asp?prog_id=434820&ci=1774&" target="_blank">Domain Registration Control Panel</a>.</p>

<p>Note that this does not mean that you won't be able to continue
domain name service without an active web hosting account. You can
continue domain name registration service through EzCheapSites.Com as long as you
choose, regardless of whether or not you still have web hosting through
EzCheapSites.Com.</p>

  <div class="top"><a href="#faq_top">Back to top</a></div>

</ul><h2>Answers: Billing and Payments</h2>
<ul><h3>If I'm not satisfied, will you give me a full refund? <a name="faq_20" id="faq_20"></a></h3>

<p>We like happy customers. If for some reason you're not satisfied
with our service, let us know. We would love the chance to work with
you to resolve any problems you experience. If you cancel within 60
days of signing up, we will provide you with a <strong>full refund</strong>.</p>

  <div class="top"><a href="#faq_top">Back to top</a></div>

<h3>Do you accept PayPal? <a name="faq_21" id="faq_21"></a></h3>

<p>At this time we do accept payments via PayPal aong with a wide range of other payments methods... </p>

  <div class="top"><a href="#faq_top">Back to top</a></div>

<h3>Can I pay by check or money order? <a name="faq_22" id="faq_22"></a></h3>

<p>EzCheapSites.Com only accepts payment via PayPal or a major credit card at this time.  We apologize for any inconvenience.</p>

  <div class="top"><a href="#faq_top">Back to top</a></div>

<h3>What credit cards do you accept? <a name="faq_23" id="faq_23"></a></h3>

<p>We currently accept Visa, Mastercard and American Express.</p>

  <div class="top"><a href="#faq_top">Back to top</a></div>

<h3>How much will I be billed upon signup? <a name="faq_24" id="faq_24"></a></h3>

<p>Upon signup, you will be charged for your first contract period. For
example, if you sign up for a six month plan, you will be charged six
times the monthly rate for that plan (the six-month discount monthly
rate, to be more specific).</p>

<p>Our order form will calculate the amount of your first invoice
before you submit your order, so that you can make sure you know
exactly what you will be charged.</p>

  <div class="top"><a href="#faq_top">Back to top</a></div>

</ul><h2>Answers: Policies, Usage and Terms of Service</h2>
<ul><h3>Do you allow Reselling on your current hosting plans? <a name="faq_33" id="faq_33"></a></h3>

<p>The short answer is "yes"... with some caveats. On our current plans
(Silver, Gold and Diamond), you are free to do with your webspace as
you may (as long as it is within the guidelines of our ToS and Service
Agreement), including selling/subletting that space to friends or
clients. In fact, with our multiple domain pointers and high resource
availabilities, our upper level plans offer a great solution if you are
looking to sublet just a few clients.</p>

<p>We do not currently offer any plans plans specifically catered
toward the traditional definition of "reselling." Our shared plans lack
many features that most potential reseller clients may be looking for
(customizable control panel, WHM, ClientExec, etc.), so the shared
plans may not fit the needs of a customer looking to enter the
"reselling" marketplace.</p>

<h3>Do you offer Reseller services? <a name="faq_34" id="faq_34"></a></h3>

<p>Yes, actually we do! As of October 2006, we have re-launched our
Reseller plans with better features and hardware than ever before.</p>

<p>You can find them at <a href="https://www.securepaynet.net/gdshop/rhp/hottestreseller.asp?prog_id=434727&ci=3271&">out reseller's information site.</a></p>

<h3>What is your Resource Usage Policy? If my site gets busy, will it be suspended? <a name="faq_35" id="faq_35"></a></h3>

<p>In shared web hosting, the ability to use your account is limited
not just by your space and bandwidth, but also by how much of your
server's resources (processor and RAM) you may be able to use at a
given time. Since you are sharing a server with many other clients,
each must operate their site within certain limits to ensure that all
accounts perform as well as expected. </p>

<p>We also completely understand, however, that webmasters are often
unaware of instances where their site is using too many resources, and
that such usage is not done maliciously. Our Level 3 staff is partially
dedicated to handling resource usage issues and working with clients to
resolve them. </p>
