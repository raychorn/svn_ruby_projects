<h1>cPanel&reg; & Web Host Manager (WHM) Hosting Platform</h1>

<p>The cPanel/WHM control panel system is the industry standard web hosting platform.
  It enables hosts to offer their customers an unmatched array of features.  Each of your
  resold accounts will have its own account management interface (called "cPanel"), which provides:</p>

<ul>

  <li>Email system management
  <li>Domain management (subdomains, pointers, parking, etc)
  <li>Database management w/ web access interface (phpMyAdmin)
  <li>Site configuration and tools
  <li>Detailed statistics and logs
  <li>Pre-installed scripts and CGIs
  <li>A feature-rich file manager
  <li>Much, much, MUCH more!
</ul>

<p>The host's control panel, WHM, provides maximum flexibility and control over resold accounts.  Even the
  most inexperienced users will find managing their hosting operations with WHM a breeze--the system is very intuitive.</p>
