<h1>Anonymous DNS and Server Name</h1>

<p>To help ensure that your resellers don't find out that you're a reseller of EzCheapSites.Com, we use an 
  anonymous domain name for our reseller servers.  For example, rather than naming a server
  "superman.EzCheapSites.Com" we would name it "superman.anonymousdomain.com" (we can't tell you the actual domain
  name here, since that would defeat the purpose!).</p>

<p>This same domain is also used to provide anonymous DNS servers to all resellers, so that instead of telling
  your customers having to point their domain names to "dns.EzCheapSites.Com", they can point to "dns.anonymousdomain.com"
  (although reseller plans with private nameservers actually get their own nameserver addresses anyway). There is
  no mention of EzCheapSites.Com in the public WHOIS record or the HTTP address for this domain.</p>
