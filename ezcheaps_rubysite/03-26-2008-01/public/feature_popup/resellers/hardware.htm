<h1>Next Generation Reseller Hardware Platform</h1>

<p>At EzCheapSites.Com, we realize that your website's performance is the most important part of your
  web hosting service.  All the features in the world aren't going to help if your website
  is down or running slowly.</p>

<p>In order to ensure a rock-solid web hosting experience, we have combined our ultra low
  site-to-server ratios with an impressive hardware platform.</p>

<p>At the center of our new generation of reseller servers are two, <strong>Dual-Core Intel&reg; Xeon</strong>
  processors, providing a total of four processing cores per machine.  This massively powerful
  CPU setup is perfect for high-availability server environments.</p>

<p>For storage, our reseller servers utilize an <strong>RAID 5 array of 10K Raptor&reg; SATA hard drives</strong>.
  This means that even if one of the hard drives in the array
  fails completely, the server will continue to run normally.  We can replace the failed 
  drive and the system will rebuild the data on-the-fly, without so much as a minute of
  downtime for your website.  In addition, the use of multiple disks increases the
  speed at which data can be read from storage, resulting in faster page loads and database queries!</p>

<p>All servers have a minimum of 4 GB high-speed RAM.</p>

<p>Impressed yet?  Just wait until you see how your sites fly on these monster machines!
  And, of course, like the rest of our hosting plans, we make extra sure that we don't
  fill servers with too many accounts.  Even the best server will perform poorly if
  overloaded and improperly managed.</p>
