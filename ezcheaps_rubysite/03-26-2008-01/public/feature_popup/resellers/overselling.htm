<h1>Disk Space & Bandwidth Overselling</h1>

<p>Although the term "overselling" generally has negative connotations, in the context of a reseller
  plan, overselling is a huge benefit.  The ability to "oversell" allows you to maximize 
  use of your disk space and bandwidth, rather than letting it go to waste.</p>

<p>Each reseller plan provides you with a pool of disk space and a pool of bandwidth
  that is shared between your resold accounts.  When you create a resold hosting account
  in your WHM control panel, you set quotas for disk space and bandwidth (either explicitly or
  by assigning it to one of your hosting packages).</p>

<p>The term "overselling" means that we only count the space and bandwidth that are actually used
  against your total pool.  So even if your disk space pool is 10 GB, you could create 50 x 1 GB
  accounts and be fine as long as the amount of disk space actually used by those accounts
  is less than 10 GB (the size of your pool).</p>
