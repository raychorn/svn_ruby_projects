<h1>RVSkin Control Panel Interface</h1>

<p>Designed with resellers in mind, RVSkin is a skin package that adds usability, functionality and additional branding capabilities to the
  standard cPanel/WHM control panel.  It is hands down the most complete and thoroughly crafted skin available for cPanel/WHM.</p>

<p>RVSkin allows for complete reseller functionality and control, giving you the ability to brand
  your customers' control panels, add/remove access to specific features, and login to their account
  as an administrator. Additionally, RVSkin is currently available in 18 languages and a host of
  colors/styles.</p>
