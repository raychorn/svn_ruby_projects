<h1>IP Addresses</h1>

<p>Every reseller plan comes with one or more IP addresses.  You can host as many accounts as you want
  on a single IP address.</p>

<p>Private nameservers (ns1.yourdomain.com and ns2.yourdomain.com) each require their own IP address, so
  any reseller plan that offers private nameservers will include at least 3 IP addresses (two for
  nameservers, and a third for hosting accounts).</p>

<p>If you need more IP addresses, you can either upgrade to the next plan or purchase them for $1/month/IP. Please note that additional IP addresses can only be purchased in conjuction with SSL.</p>
