<h1>Bandwidth Pool</h1>

<p>Your "bandwidth pool" is the amount of bandwidth that you are given to share between all of your
  accounts (your primary account and resold accounts).  The concept is the same as the disk space pool.</p>

<p>The total amount of bandwidth used by all of your resold accounts in a month
  can not exceed your bandwidth pool.  You don't need to keep track of this yourself,
  our systems will automatically track your usage and enforce this limit.</p>

<p>You can easily set bandwidth limits for each of your resold accounts through the WHM control panel.</p>
