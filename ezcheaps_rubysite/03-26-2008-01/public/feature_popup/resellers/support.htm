<h2>Knowledgeable, Non-Outsourced Support</h2>

<p>We know that you depend on us to help you keep your customers happy.  That's why 
  everyone you will interact with while reselling for us is a direct EzCheapSites.Com employee. 
  We don't use any third-party outsourcing or staffing
  agencies, since there's no way to guarantee that they will provide our resellers with the
  top-notch support that EzCheapSites.Com customers have come to expect.  Keeping our entire team in-house allows us 
  to ensure our resellers get the best hosting experience possible, as
  we have the ability to decide who interacts with our customers and how those people are trained.</p>
