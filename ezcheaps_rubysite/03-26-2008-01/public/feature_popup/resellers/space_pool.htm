<h1>Disk Space Pool</h1>

<p>Your "disk space pool" is the amount of disk space that you are given to share between all of your
  accounts (your primary account and resold accounts).  The concept is the same as the bandwidth pool.</p>

<p>The total amount of disk space used by all of your resold accounts
  can not exceed the size of your disk space pool.  You don't need to keep track of this yourself,
  our systems will automatically track your usage and enforce this limit.</p>

<p>You can easily set disk space limits for each of your resold accounts through the WHM control panel.</p>
