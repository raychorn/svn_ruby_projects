<h1>Instant MX Record Modification</h1>

<p>A domain name's MX record determines where its email is routed.  By default, all of your
  domain names will route to EzCheapSites.Com's mail servers so that you can manage email through our
  control panel.  If, however, you need to use a third party email solution requiring MX
  record modification, our DNS zone file editor allows you to do so without the need for EzCheapSites.Com
  staff intervention.</p>

<p>Services like <a href="http://www.bigmailbox.com/" target="_blank">BigMailBox.com</a>,
  <a href="http://www.everyone.net" target="_blank">Everyone.net</a> and 
  <a href="https://www.google.com/hosted" target="_blank">Google for your domain</a> allow you to offer
  webmail on your domain name to the general public.  These are examples of services which
  require MX record modification.</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> EzCheapSites.Com does not provide support for these or any other third party services
  that you use in conjunction with your account.</p>
