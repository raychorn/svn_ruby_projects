<h1>Unlimited mySQL Databases</h1>

<p>MySQL is the web's most popular open source database engine, and powers the vast majority of web
  applications (blogs, forums, shopping carts and more).  Applications powered by mySQL generally
  run much faster than those which use text files to store data.</p>

<p>With your account, you are allowed to create an unlimited number of mySQL databases.
  Databases can be managed using our control panel.  You can create an unlimited number of
  mySQL users with different permissions, as well as modify access lists for different
  hostnames.  This would allow you to access your database directly from your home development
  server, for example.</p>

<p>We also provide a pre-installed and configured version of 
  <a href="http://www.phpmyadmin.net/" target="_blank">phpMyAdmin</a>, which allows you to manage
  all of your databases through an easy to use web interface.</p>

<p>For more information on mySQL, visit the project's
  <a href="http://www.mysql.com/" target="_blank">official website</a>.</p>
