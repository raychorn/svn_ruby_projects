<h1>Secure SSL Certificate</h1>

<p>We provide a server-wide SSL (Secure Socket Layer) certificate which allows you to conduct secure
  web transactions with website visitors.  SSL should be used for all sensitive ecommerce transactions,
  and EzCheapSites.Com's free SSL support makes the process a breeze!</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> If you have purchased your own SSL certificate from a third party, EzCheapSites.Com will install
  your certificate on our servers for a small one-time fee.  Please contact our
  customer service department for assistance.</p>
