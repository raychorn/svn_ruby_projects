<h2>Knowledgeable, Non-Outsourced Support</h2>

<p>Everyone you will interact with while hosting with us is a direct EzCheapSites.Com employee. 
  We don't use any third-party outsourcing or staffing
  agencies.  We've found that this allows us to provide our customers the best hosting experience possible, as
  we have the ability to decide who interacts with our customers and how they are trained.</p>
