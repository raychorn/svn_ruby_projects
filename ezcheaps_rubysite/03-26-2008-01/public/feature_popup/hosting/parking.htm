<h1>Parked Domain Names</h1>

<p>A parked domain is an additional domain name that points to your
  main website.  Parked domain names are useful if you use multiple
  domain names to access your website.</p>

<p>Unlike domain pointers, parked domain names can not point to their 
  own website and can not be used for email.  They simply point to
  your main website.</p>

<p>You may add as many parked domains as you like with any of our hosting plans.</p>

<p>For an in-depth explanation of domain parking and how it compares to
  domain pointing, <a href="/support/kb/article.php?id=020" target="_blank">click here</a>.</p>
