<h1>Ultra-Low Number of Sites per Server</h1>

<p>We are dedicated to providing lightning fast web hosting, which is why we boast one of the lowest sites per server ratios
  in the industry.  Instead of being overcrowded, our servers are <strong>undercrowded</strong>.</p>

<p>The number of accounts hosted on a web server can have a significant impact on how quickly that server is able to respond
  to page requests.  Since system resources such as processor time and RAM are shared by all users of a server, a server with
  too many accounts can be slow to respond and cause your site's visitors to become frustrated and leave.</p>

<p>Many hosting companies pack too many accounts onto each server in an effort to maximize profit.  At EzCheapSites.Com, we feel that
  the long term customer satisfaction resulting from providing high performance hosting is far more important than the short
  term profits made by overfilling servers.  Our customers love the extra speed they get at EzCheapSites.Com, making them more than happy
  to recommend EzCheapSites.Com to their friends, family and website visitors.</p>

<p>Join EzCheapSites.Com today and experience the many benefits of our "undercrowded" servers!</p>
