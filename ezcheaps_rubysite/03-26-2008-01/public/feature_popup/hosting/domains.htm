<h1>Domain Pointers</h1>

<p>Domain pointers are one of our most popular and powerful features. Domain 
pointers allow you to easily add domains that point to directories within your 
hosting, yet act as their own separate website showing your pointed domain 
URL.</p>

<p>Domain pointers can have email addresses and even subdomains, and can be
  managed centrally from our easy to use SiteAdmin control panel.</p>
